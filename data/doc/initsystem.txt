// :TODO: Add documentation

BASE has an init system that will imediately setup your website to be ready
to use. If updates are available, this same init system can also update your
website to be up to date again automatically. use ./scripts/base/init to
perform the init process. Use the "force" arugment to force init from zero
(WARNING: This will destroy your database and start from scratch). Due to
"force" being slightly dangerous, it does not work on production, where the
option "dump" has to be used to first dump the database, then a subsequent
normal init will reestablish a new database

BASE basically tracks 4 versions; a framework versions (in code and database) and a project version
(in code and database). If the init script is run, and either of the framework or project the
database version differs from the code version, the init script will try to execute the required
PHP scripts that lie in between that difference to make the database version match the code version
again

ROOT/scripts/base/init arguments:

force

fromprojectversion     This will force the init script to start from the specified project version
                       file. It basically tells the script that the real project database version
                       should be ignored, and the specified one should be used instead

fromframeworkversion   This will force the init script to start from the specified framework version
                       file. It basically tells the script that the real framework database version
                       should be ignored, and the specified one should be used instead
