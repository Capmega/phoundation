// :TODO: Complete documentation

Base based projects can add SSO support for various platforms using the sso.php library.

The "sso.php" library uses the "socialmedia-oauth-login" library set by a symlink called "sol" All these should be in the libs directory.

Each SSO platform requires $_CONFIG['sso'][PLATFORMNAME] configuration, and support in the sso() function call

An SSO test program is located in www/en/tests/sso.php
