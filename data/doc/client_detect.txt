// :TODO: Add documentation

client_detect() (located in system.php library file) can detect what client we are dealing with (
crawler, desktop, mobile, etc)

See browscap.txt for required PHP configuration

NOTE! Though it may be useful in certain situations, client detection is prone to failing and not
considered a "best practice"!
