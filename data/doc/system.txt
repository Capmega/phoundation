System options:

The following command line options apply to nearly every script, as long as
they can support it or if it is relevant.



Internal    Command line            Description
variable    parameters



FORCE       --force, -F             (Obsolete) Will force things

NOCOLOR     --no-color, -C          The executed script will now display
                                    everything without color

TEST        --test, -T              Certain scripts will not execute data
                                    changing actions, but run normally for the
                                    rest

TIMEZONE    --timezone TIMEZONE     Use the specified timezone

LANGUAGE    --language, -L          Use the specified language

VERSION     --version               Print the current framework and project
                                    versions

VERBOSE     --verbose, -V           Scripts will output more information.
                                    commands executed with safe_exec() or
                                    script_exec() will be printed as well. Note
                                    that this also applies to the log output

VERYVERBOSE --very-verbose, -VV     Scripts will output even more information.
                                    commands executed with safe_exec() or
                                    script_exec() will have their output logged
                                    to the screen as well

QUIET       --quiet, -Q             Scripts will output as little as possible.
                                    Script headers and footers will not be
                                    printed, for example. This is useful when
                                    output needs to be parsed

LIMIT       --limit LIMIT           If the script needs to display a list of
                                    items, limit that list to the specified
                                    LIMIT amount. Defaults to
                                    $_CONFIG[paging][limit], which is usually
                                    around 20 - 50. Set to 0 to have no limit

PAGE        --page, -P              If using LIMIT, this can be used to see the
                                    next page

DEBUG       --debug, -D             If specified, force the program to run in
                                    debug mode, even though configuration has
                                    debug disabled

USAGE       --usage, -U, usage      Shows examples on how to utilize the script.
                                    Nearly every script has this supported

HELP        --help, -H, help        Display the help file for the specified
                                    script. Nearly every script has a
                                    comprehensive help file available

ENVIRONMENT --env, -E ENVIRONMENT   Use the specified environment ENVIRONMENT.
                                    This is useful if no environment variable was
                                    setup (yet) using
                                    "export PROJECTNAME_ENVIRONMENT=ENVIRONMENT"
                                    where PROJECTNAME is the name of your
                                    project, and ENVIRONMENT is the name of your
                                    environment (typically one of production,
                                    trial, or local), or you wish to execute the
                                    command using a different environment


CLEAN_DEBUG --clean-debug           This will remove all extra spaced from the
                                    printed queries, making them clean and very
                                    easy to copy / paste

-           --skip-init-check, -I   This will have phoundation skip the test if
                                    the database is at the correct version and
                                    requires an init
