// :TODO: Add documentation

All configuration files are in /config

Configuration files are cascading (files that are read later can override configuration settings made in files read earlier), and will be read in this order:

/config/default.php (This file may NEVER be modified as it is a base configuration file, it will be overwritten by the /scripts/base/update script!)
/config/production[_SUBENVIRONMENTNAME].php This is the production configuration. The _SUBENVIRONMENT part is optional, and will be used only if the site uses sub environments
[/config/ENVIRONMENT[_SUBENVIRONMENTNAME].php] Optionally read, only if not in production. ENVIRONMENT will be the name of the configured environment


ENVIRONMENTS



SUBENVIRONMENTS (optional)
