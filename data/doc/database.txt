// :TODO: Add documentation

BASE uses the PHP PDO library for database access. In theory, all databases
supported by PDO should work, though BASE has only been tested with MySQL.

Most tables have an "`id` INT(11) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT" column
If a status is required for each row, use "`status` VARCHAR(16) NULL" column.
Most tables are InnoDB
