// :TODO: Add documentation

This document contains a list of hosting providers I have found. NOTE! This list is in no way an
endorsement for any of these hosters, I may have tried some, while others not. Use this list only
to help you see what is out there.

IMPORTANT: OPENVZ (Virtuozzo for example) providers may give VPS that cannot have swap!
