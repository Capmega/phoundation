If you want to build multiple websites that all use the same code base, but
have different configuration, database, CSS, etc, then subenvironments can help
you. Examples of this could be multiple directory websites for different
cities, where each one has their own configuration, CSS layout, and database,
but they all are of one and the same project.

A sub environment causes BASE to load an extra configuration file for each
subenvironment it loads. If your environment would be "test", and your sub
environment "amsterdam", BASE would load configuration files
./config/production.php, ./config/production_amsterdam.php,
./config/test.php, ./config/test_amsterdam.php. This way, you can have
different configurations for the different sub environments. To use these
different sub environments, in apache specify SetEnv PROJECT_SUBENVIRONMENT
subenvironmentname and on the shell specify export
PROJECT_SUBENVIRONMENT=subenvironmentname;, or run commands like
./scripts/base/init subenv amsterdam. To be abel use sub environments, set
REQUIRE_SUBENVIRONMENTS in ./config/projects.php to "true"
