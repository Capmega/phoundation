// :TODO: Add documentation

* Easy to use
  Just include the startup.php library like this: require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../libs/startup.php');
  and correct for the location as necesary. After this line, the following libraries (with their functions)
  will automatically be loaded: startup, system, strings, arrays, and pdo. The system will have checked if
  the running script is a web page or a command line script, and have executed appropriate actions. If the
  current script is a command line, the cli library will be loaded as well, if the current script is a webpage
  then the html and http libraries will also be loaded. Configuration for the current environment will also
  have been loaded. Check the libraries for which functions will be available.

  Some pointers:
  load_libs(); [system library] accepts a CSV string or array with library names to load
  str_from(haystack, needle); [string library] returns the haystack string from (and without) the specified needle
  str_until(haystack, needle); returns the haystack string until (and without) the specified needle
  argument(name); [cli library] returns true if the specified argument name has been specified
  argument(name, true); [cli library] Returns the value right after the specified argument name. Ideal for "script add user", argument("add") will return "user"
  argument(number); [cli library] returns the value of the specified nth argument
  html_select(data); [html library] returns complete <select></select> HTML code with contents
  html_js_load(js_file_name_without_extension); [html library] registers that the specified javascript file should be loaded to the server. BASE will ensure that its added either in the <head> tag, or in case of delayed loading, at the end of the <body> block
  html_css_load(css_file_name_without_extension); [html library] registers that the specified css file should be loaded to the server. BASE will ensure that its added either in the <head> tag, or in case of delayed loading, at the end of the <body> block
