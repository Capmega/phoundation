@title Preface

The Phoundation Project is a PHP-based procedural website development framework. It consists of hundreds of libraries covering near every needed
functionality for websites, and then some. Its main design ideas were security, ease and speed of development, low resource usage, and just a large
collection of functionalities.

This manual covers the basics for the setup & installation of the Phoundation Project, as well as an extensive function reference and detailed
features offered by the framework.
