System Library (system.php)
    As stated in the preface, The Phoundation Project is a procedural framework aiming to maximize ease and speed while developing, as well as minimizing
    resource usage. To that purpose, The Phoundation Project lists hundreds of different libraries, each one comprising several functions. The first
    library is the `system.php` library, which, as its name suggests, contains all system functions for Phoundation. The `system.php` library is one of
    the very few Phoundation libraries to execute code directly. It creates the $core object and defines the CoreException class which is the default
    exception thrown by Phoundation functions. This is so the system gets minimal functionality from the get-go.

    $core is the main object for Phoundation. After the `system` library has automatically loaded , determines the platform (cli or http). After this,
    depending on the platform, the `startup.php` library calls the core object's public function `startup` to determine what platform is being used
    (Either command line -CLI- or a webserver -HTTP-) and for HTTP calls, it will determine the "call type". The call type is basically the type of page
    eing requested (a normal HTTP page, an AJAX request, etc). The call type differentiates between http web pages, admin web pages (pages with /admin,
    showing the admin section), ajax requests (URL's starting with /ajax), api requests (URL's starting with /api), system pages (any 404, 403, 500,
    503, etc. page), Google AMP pages (any URL starting with /amp), and explicit mobile pages (any URL starting with /mobile). $core will automatically
    run the correct handler for the specified request, which will automatically load the required libraries, setup timezones, configure language and
    locale, and load the custom library.
