@title Phoundation Basics



    As stated in the preface, The Phoundation Project is a procedural framework aiming to maximize ease and speed while developing, as well as minimizing resource usage.
    To that purpose, The Phoundation Project lists hundreds of different libraries, each one comprising several functions. A key element of The Phoundation Project's
    architecture is the minimal usage of objects, which makes a paramount to understand the library, script and page structure. All of the .php files are either libraries,
    configuration files or specific pages that render HTML to serve clients. The "scripts" folder contains executable files to automate various system operations.
