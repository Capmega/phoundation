Xapian is an external library that allows you to add advanced indexing and search facilities to
yur own website. BASE has support for easy xapian use built in, though the library must be build
or installed manually. This document explains how to build or install this library, and how to use
the functionalities in the xapianbase library.



*** HOW TO BUILD / INSTALL XAPIAN EXTERNAL LIBRARY ***

* Install Xapian under Ubuntu (This seems NOT to work for Mint!)

http://trac.xapian.org/wiki/FAQ/PHP%20Bindings%20Package

sudo apt-get build-dep xapian-bindings devscripts
sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-cli devscripts
apt-get source xapian-bindings
cd xapian-bindings-1.2.*
rm -f debian/control debian/*-stamp
env PHP_VERSIONS=5 debian/rules maint
sed -i 's!include_path=php5$!include_path=$(srcdir)/php5!' php/Makefile.in
echo auto-commit >> debian/source/options
env DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck debuild -e PHP_VERSIONS=5 -us -uc
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i php5-xapian_*.deb

IMPORTANT! : When updating Xapian database in PHP, Do NOT forget to flush the
             Xapian database data with $database = null and $indexer = null or
             all unflushed data will be lost

* Install Xapian under CentOS6.4 with PHP5.3
Just do yum install xapian-core php-xapian.x86_64

Install Xapian under CentOS6.4 with PHP5.5
sudo su -
Download latest xapian-core and xapian-bindings from http://xapian.org/download to /usr/src
tar -xvf both files, in core, ./configure; make -j cores; make install. In bindings, ./configure --with-php; make -j cores; make install

The xapian.php will probably be installed in /usr/local/share/php5/ but PHP won't look there, so symlink to /usr/share/php!

See http://xapian.org/docs/bindings/php/ for more information



*** HOW TO USE XAPIAN BASE LIBRARY ***

NOTE: There are two libraries related to xapian; "xapian.php" and "xapianbase.php". The former is
the official xapian interface, the latter is the BASE xapian library that contains functions to
make usage easier. You should normally load "xapianbase", which autoamtically will also load
"xapian" by itself

Use load_libs('xapianbase'); to load the library and have the functions available

The xapianbase will give you the xapianbase object which you can use
