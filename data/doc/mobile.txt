// :TODO: Add documentation

This documentation contains information relevant to mobile support on BASE

* $_CONFIG['mobile']['enabled'] can be set to true (mobile is supported), false
  (mobile is disabled) or "limited" (mobile is only available to specified
  users)

* If mobile is enabled, and a mobile device is detected, base will
  automatically switch to mobile site by setting $_SESSION[mobile]['site']
  to true

* If the current session is in mobile site mode, for each page in www/LANGUAGE
  it will look in www/LANGUAGE/mobile if a mobile version is available and if
  a mobile version is available, execute that one instead of the standard page.
  If no mobile version is available, the normal page will be executed instead.

* startup library sets for each page load $GLOBALS['page_is_mobile'] if
  current page is running as mobile or not

* startup library sets for session $_SESSION[mobile] and $_SESSION[device]
  associative arrays

* $_SESSION[mobile] contains information about current mobile settings
  (mobile_detect() is used for this)

* $_SESSION[device] contains information about the current client device
  (detect_client() is used for this)

* www/LANGUAGE/gotomobile.php sets $_SESSION[mobile]['site'] to true, and
  tries to redirect back to the origin as inteligently as possible

* www/LANGUAGE/gotonormal.php sets $_SESSION[mobile]['site'] to false, and
  tries to redirect back to the origin as inteligently as possible

* $GLOBALS['page_is_mobile'] is set to true if the current page is in mobile
  mode, false if not. This variable is set on each page load, and is a reliable
  way to determine if a mobile page is processed or a normal one.
