geo importer problems:
If the geo importer fails with "The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version"
then please try the notlocal commandline option. The reason for this is that some newer
MySQL servers have a "security" feature of completely not allowing LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
anymore, but they do allow LOAD DATA INFILE which requires files to be located in
/var/lib/mysql. Do note that, due to the required locations of these files, a symlink will
be made there which require root rights. Also note that LOAD DATA INFILE requires File_priv Y
in the mysql user table for that user!
