// :TODO: Add documentation

This document contains various "problems and their solutions" that I have encountered

Problem:
"Headers already sent" errors like

Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent"
Warning: header() [function.header]: Cannot send headers - headers already sent"

But all on on line 1 of some root .php file :
This file either contains a space at the beginning, or a BOM. Since BOM is
not directly visible (a HEX editor will show it), it may cause confusion

Solution:
run the ./scripts/base/clearbom script, it will clear all BOMs from all PHP scripts. This script
normally automatically runs with the ROOT/scripts/base/deploy script



Problem:
PHP mail() slow?
1) Use postfix instead of sendmail

2) Make sure that the computer hostname is myhost.domain.com, and that the
following line is in your /etc/hosts file (where "myserver" is the hostname
of your computer)!

127.0.0.1               localhost localhost.localdomain myhost.domain.com

NOTE: The reason why its slow is that sendmail waits for 60 seconds (WHY??)
when the hostname is not a FQDN, so "myhost" will cause this problem whereas
"myhost.domain.com" will not
