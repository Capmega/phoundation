BASE has a wordpress library available that allows you to post pages or posts via the HTML admin
interface. These library functions do NOT use the normal API to post pages since this API contains
several bugs and limitations.

I have found that posting many pages with parent pages in wordpress slows WP down to a crash around
10.000 pages since for every admin page load it will load a combo box showing all possible parents.
Because of this, it is necesary to disable that parents select box which can be done with the
following wordpress plugin

In wordpresroot/wp-content/plugins, add the following PHP code in the file file test.php. Then go to
wordpress admin section > plugins > disabled plugins, then enable plugin "test"
