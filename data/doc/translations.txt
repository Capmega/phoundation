// :TODO: Add documentation

BASE has support for multilingual websites. It uses static, pre translated texts for speed, so
during the running of the PHP script, no translations have to be done. This does mean, however,
that before the website can be run in a different language, that BASE has to do the complete
translation. Each language has its own language code under www/ and for each translation, a
complete translated tree copy will be made.

BASE contains two types of texts that may be translated.

Type one are the small, usually one short phrase or word texts. These texts are all marked
throughout the code with the tr() function {system library}. The translator can search for these
tr() texts, and replace them with the correct translations from the database (if available)

Type two are larger patches of texts which are stored in separate HTML files in
ROOT/data/content/LANGUAGE/. Again, each language must have its own complete tree, and each HTML
file should have a copy in each language. These files are added to the site using the
load_content() function {system library}

The translation system checks the configuration $_CONFIG['languages']['available'] to see what
languages should be available, and with the ROOT/scripts/base/translate script, the translations
will be made. Usually, upon site deployment using ./scripts/base/deploy, these translations will be
made automatically.

A translator can make the required translations in an admin web interface with the "translate" page
(See ROOT/www/en/admin/translate.php)
