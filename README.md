It consists of hundreds of libraries covering near every needed functionality for websites, and then some. Its main design ideas were security, ease and speed of development, low resource usage, and just a large collection of functionalities.

Some features include:

* Fully automated deployment system that checks code, minifies CSS / JS, translates, sends code to remote server, and updates all file mode settings

* Environment based configuration. Different environments have different configurations

* Automated initialization system that depending on version differences between code and database automatically upgrades database and file structures as required

* Syncing of database and file content between environments

* Update system that fully upgrades all framework files

* Multi lingual with automatic application of translations

* Users / Roles / Rights management

* On the fly CSS / JS bundler

* Most core functionalties are available through web UI and CLI

* Auto documentation generator (Currently under construction)

* Multiple database connections easily managed and can be automatically tunneled over SSH

* Servers management

* Devices management over multiple servers

* Over 200 libraries with loads of web functionalties but also functionalities like scanner management, fingerprint reader support, crypto currencies support, sms support, etc.
