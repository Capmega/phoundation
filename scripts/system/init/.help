This script will initialize the database and system files to leave your data structures up to date with the current code version



METHODS



drop                             - DROP, will drop the core database. Usually
                                   used on production systems in case the
                                   database needs to be dropped



reset                            - Reset the database version back to the current
                                   code version in case it is ahead. Any extra
                                   entries in the versions table AFTER the
                                   current version will be wiped. This option
                                   does NOT allow to reset the database version
                                   in case the current code version is ahead. For
                                   that, a normal init must be executed



>NONE<                           - Will execute the init system normally with the
                                   following arguments



ARGUMENTS

[-f [VERSION]]                   - Run init from framework version VERSION. If

                                   last framework database version will be
                                   assumed

[-p [VERSION]]                   - Run init from project version VERSION. If
                                   VERSION has not been specified, the current
                                   last project database version will be assumed

[-F, --force]                    - FORCE, will drop the core database and start
                                   init from version 0. NOTE: For safety against

                                   `sql_connectors` database table for database
                                   connectors

[-v | --section-version VERSION] - Only applies to section initialization. Will
                                   initialize the specified section starting at

[--fromprojectversion]           - Make init fake the current project version registered
                                   in the databaes to be the version number that follows

[--fromframeworkversion]        - Make init fake the current project version registered
